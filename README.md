# siddump-go
A Go version of the siddump tool!

I wanted to learn more about Go and decided to port the excellent siddump tool that exists in the public domain in C, to Go. This porject will most certainly evolve as I get more proficient in Go. :)

Feel free to come with suggestions for improvements.

For the 6502 chip emulation, I did not go with the original code but rather used an existing Go library found here:

Thanks to the author for providing this, seems to work nicely!

Enjoy!
